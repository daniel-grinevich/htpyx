            "description": "This light web framework is centered on a component-based approach to Python web development. This framework leverages HTMX to create responsive websites efficiently. It features an ORM, template engine, and well-structured routing with view classes. Uniquely, it utilizes a JSON-based database system for data storage, adopting a NoSQL approach to manage data dynamically. This design not only facilitates rapid development but also ensures scalability and flexibility in handling diverse web application needs.",

Aimed at enhancing user experience in fast-paced environments, this coffee machine allows customers to select their beverage choice from a mobile app, which then generates a unique QR code for their order. Upon scanning the QR code at the machine, the system automatically retrieves the order details and precisely brews the selected coffee variant, delivering a perfectly tailored cup every time.",
